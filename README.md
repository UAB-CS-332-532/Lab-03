## Assignment:

Modify your Lab-02 solution (or the provided one) to sort an array of strings and use dynamic memory allocation.

1. Dynamically allocate memory for the array based on the number of strings in the array.

2. For each string, dynamically allocate memory based on the size of the string.

3. Use the *scanf()* to read in each string.

4. Create a function to read in the strings (e.g. readStrings), a function to sort the strings (e.g. sortStrings), and a function to display the strings (e.g. displayStrings).

You can utilize the malloc() function to dynamically allocate memory and strlen() to find the length of a string.
